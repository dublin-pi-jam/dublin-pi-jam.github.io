<h1>Dublin Raspberry Pi Jam</h1>
<p>We are the first to host an Irish Pi Jam in the Republic of Ireland, and are planning to host more in the future. We have a  Dublin Pi Jam Mailing List (open to all to join): <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dublin-raspberry-pi-jam">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dublin-raspberry-pi-jam</a></p>
<p>Any Enquiries: <a href="mailto:pijam@eventgeek.ie">pijam@eventgeek.ie</a></p>

<h1>Our Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>


<h1>The Quick Version</h1>
<p>Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event (without a refund, if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers.</p>

<h1>The Less Quick Version</h1>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organisers immediately.</p>

<p>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events.</p>
